I wonder which ingredients on the salad bar are the most requested for to go orders.

What I need to do this:
1. A series of buttons with unique IDs each one of them represent an item from the salad bar.
2. Each button will have an onClick that just counts how many times it's been clicked.
    2a. It would be best if these buttons had some sort of response to confirm the click has registered, like a noise.  (Maybe just rely on console logs for now?)
3. Button to display totals in a table.  Maybe as percentages of a whole?  Definitely console logs.
4. Option to add entries that are requested but do not exists.  Like Turkey and Banana Peppers.  Would it be a signfiicant percentage to justify adding those items?
5. I think I'll need to use a database integration in there somehow.  Because I need to be able to store that data.  That's gonna be some node stuff.  I'm sure.
